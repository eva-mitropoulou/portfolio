# HPC Workflow & Research Infrastructure

## Project Focus

Computational chemistry is not only about running calculations. Strong computational researchers also create environments that are reproducible, maintainable, and observable. This case study documents infrastructure and workflow work that supports chemistry workloads in practice.

## What Was Built

- bash-based environment bootstrap logic for ORCA and Quantum ESPRESSO installation
- path and binary setup for reusable Linux environments
- SLURM cluster configuration for multi-node CPU resources
- monitoring stack with Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, and node exporter
- dashboard provisioning for tracking host-level computational workload behavior

## Selected Technical Evidence

### Bootstrap Automation

The source workspace includes automation for:

- dependency installation
- ORCA extraction and path wiring
- Quantum ESPRESSO installation and optional build
- Docker and monitoring startup

### SLURM Configuration

The source workspace includes a real cluster configuration with:

- node definitions
- partition setup
- authentication and control configuration
- completion hooks

### Monitoring

Dashboard provisioning shows awareness of:

- CPU load
- memory/swap behavior
- basic observability for sustained computational workloads

## Core Competencies Demonstrated

- Automating the deployment of Linux-based computational chemistry environments
- Orchestrating multi-node CPU resources and scheduling pipelines via SLURM
- Engineering robust, reproducible workflow infrastructures suitable for both academic and industrial R&D
